# Hackathon Challenge 01

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for a machine learning task using transformer models. The notebook utilizes the Hugging Face `transformers` library and PyTorch for building and training models, and the `datasets` library for handling datasets.

## Overview

The project involves:
- Loading datasets for text processing tasks.
- Tokenizing input text using pretrained tokenizers.
- Fine-tuning a transformer model (e.g., T5) for specific natural language processing tasks.
- Training the model using the Hugging Face `Trainer` API.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are essential for this notebook:

- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers): For model implementation and tokenizer.
- [Hugging Face Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets): For loading and preprocessing datasets.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): For tensor computations and model fine-tuning.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webgeekhabib007/Team_NPCs_Bitfest_Hackathon2025
   cd main/challange01
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets torch
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook hackathon_challange01.ipynb
   ```

## Key Features

- **Dataset Handling**: Uses `datasets` library to load and preprocess text data efficiently.
- **Transformer Model Fine-Tuning**: Implements fine-tuning for transformer models like T5.
- **Trainer API**: Simplifies the training and evaluation process using `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments`.

## How to Use

1. **Load Dataset**: Update the dataset path or identifier in the corresponding code cell.
2. **Configure Model**: Specify the pretrained model checkpoint in the tokenizer and model initialization steps.
3. **Train the Model**: Configure training parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the training arguments.
4. **Evaluate**: Use the trained model for predictions and evaluation.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the notebook to:
- Use a different transformer model.
- Add custom preprocessing steps for your dataset.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
