# Hackathon Challenge 01: Transformer Model for NLP Tasks

Welcome to **Hackathon Challenge 01**! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that showcases the power of transformer models for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The notebook leverages cutting-edge libraries like Hugging Face `transformers` and PyTorch to build, train, and fine-tune a model on your chosen text data.

## üöÄ Overview

In this challenge, we focus on:
- **Loading Datasets**: Efficiently handle and preprocess large-scale text data using the `datasets` library.
- **Tokenization**: Seamlessly tokenize text using pretrained tokenizers from the Hugging Face Hub.
- **Fine-Tuning Transformer Models**: Fine-tune powerful models like T5 for a wide range of NLP tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation.
- **Model Training**: Train the model using the Hugging Face `Trainer` API to ensure a smooth and reproducible training process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries & Tools

This project utilizes the following powerful tools:

- **[Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)**: Easily implement transformer models and access pretrained models and tokenizers.
- **[Hugging Face Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)**: Efficiently load, preprocess, and manage datasets for NLP tasks.
- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**: The deep learning framework used for building and fine-tuning models.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Setup Instructions

Follow these simple steps to get started with the notebook:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webgeekhabib007/Team_NPCs_Bitfest_Hackathon2025
   cd main/challange01

2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install transformers datasets torch

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook hackathon_challange01.ipynb


‚ú® Key Features
Efficient Dataset Handling: Easily load and preprocess text data using the datasets library, ensuring smooth workflows.
Transformer Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune state-of-the-art transformer models like T5 to tackle your specific NLP tasks.
Simplified Training with Trainer API: Leverage Hugging Face‚Äôs Trainer API to handle model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

üîß How to Use
Load Dataset: Update the dataset path or identifier in the corresponding code cell to load your dataset.
Configure Model: Specify the pretrained model checkpoint (e.g., t5-small, bert-base-uncased) when initializing the model and tokenizer.
Train the Model: Configure training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs using the TrainingArguments.
Evaluate: Once the model is trained, use it for predictions and evaluation on your test data.

‚öôÔ∏è Customization
Feel free to modify the notebook to:
Use a different transformer model (e.g., GPT-2, BERT, etc.).
Add custom preprocessing steps for your dataset.
Experiment with hyperparameters to optimize performance.
